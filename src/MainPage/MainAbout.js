          <Para>
            Cooking for me has always been a form of expression and love. It
            fills my soul when I get to cook for someone. A few years ago I
            decided to start my own meal prep business and it was there when I
            really understood the meaning behind quality food, and how important
            it is to a successful day. I genuinely enjoy creating healthy
            recipes for people to make in their homes and for their families.
            Iâ€™ve recently enjoyed crafting easy to make cocktails too, so much
            fun!

          <Header2>MY MISSION</Header2>
          <Para>
            I enjoy creating healthy recipes that don't lack in flavor. A simple
            cocktail is my main goal, too! I believe in using quality
            ingredients that offer great taste. Along with creating simple
            recipes, I also enjoy the creative space of food and cocktail
            photography.
